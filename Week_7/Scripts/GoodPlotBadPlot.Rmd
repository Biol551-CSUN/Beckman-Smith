# Introduction
Today, I will be demonstrating the differences between good and bad data visualization using the Tidy Tuesday dataset _**UFO Sightings Around the World**_.

# Bad Plot
Here we see an example of a terrible plot. From the get-go, a **bar graph combined with a polar coordinate graph** is not a good choice to represent this data. It is **overly confusing**. The other most glaring problem with this plot is that the legend is **overlapping and obscuring** the graph. The **colors** for all of the chart elements make the figure hard to read and look at. The title, subtitle, and data labels are **not descriptive** and are **formatted incorrectly**. The legend, bar labels, and coordinate labels are all **redundant**. It is impossible to tell what exactly the bar length is measuring using the axis, and the mass of bar labels towards the center completely blocks out the bars themselves.

# Bonus Bad Plot
#### Although not made in ggplot2, I wanted to try my hand at the infamous 3D pie chart. I like that it looks like a UFO itself. 
This plot is a **pie chart**, and pie charts are notoriously bad at representing data accurately. On top of that, it is a **3D** pie chart, which makes it unnecessarily more complex and adds an extra dimension that no variable is being plotted on. The labels are **impossible to read**, as they overlap each other and are a bad color. The **single color** of the pie makes it more difficult to distinguish the different states from one another. The data labels and title are also **improperly capitalized**. The title is **not descriptive enough**, and there are **no actual numbers** that the pie graph represents. The data source is **not credited** with a caption. The most one could glean from this graph is that California has the most UFO sightings.    
```{r}
par(bg = "black", #changed background color
    col.main = "red") #changed title color
pie3D(ufo_states_clean$count, #created a 3D pie chart with the sightings count column of the cleaned ufo data
      labels = ufo_states_clean$region, #used the state column for labels 
      edges = 1, #made the edges of each slice flat
      radius = 3, #altered the radius of the pie
      height = 0.2, #made the pie taller
      theta = 0.2, #rotated the viewing angle of the pie
      border = "yellow", #changed the border color
      col = "green", #changed the slice color 
      labelcol = "red", #changed the label color
      labelcex = 1, #changed the label size
      explode = 0.1, #moved the slices slightly apart
      shade = 0.5, #shaded the slices for a more 3D effect
      main = "ufo sightings") #added a title
  
```

# Good Plot
In contrast, here is an example of a better graph representing the same data. This plot uses a **map** of the states filled in using a gradient to represent the number of sightings. The **colors** are easier to understand, and the **legend** clearly states the number of sightings being portrayed. The title, legend, and caption are all **legible and detailed**.   
```{r}
states_map <- map_data("state") #brought in map data for the US states
sightings_map <- left_join(states_map, ufo_states_clean, by = "region") #joined the state map data with my ufo data 

ggplot(sightings_map, #created a ggplot with this combined data
       aes(long, 
           lat, 
           group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(fill = count), #created a geom_polygon using the sightings count as the fill  
               color = "white") + #made the borders between states white
  scale_fill_gradient(name = "UFO Sightings", #added a gradient scale for the fill, gave the legend a title 
                      low = "lightgreen", high = "darkgreen", #set the colors for the fill gradient 
                      trans = "log10", #changed gradient to log scale to make it easier to see all of the states and not just CA
                      breaks = c(150,300,2000,4000,6000,8000), #set which values I wanted to see labeled in the legend 
                      guide = guide_legend(keyheight = unit(5, units = "mm"), #changed the legend box height
                                           keywidth = unit(8, units = "mm"), #changed the legend box width
                                           label.position = "bottom", #changed the legend label position
                                           title.position = 'top', #changed the legend title position
                                           nrow = 1)) + #made it so all the boxes appeared in a single row

        plot.caption = element_text(size = 12, #changed the size of the caption
                                    hjust = 0.95, #changed the horizontal position of the caption
                                    vjust = 3, #changed the vertical position of the caption
